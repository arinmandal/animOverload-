## Embark on Your Three.js Adventure: A Beginner's Guide

Welcome to the exciting world of Three.js! This guide provides a roadmap for your journey into creating immersive 3D experiences using JavaScript.

**Fundamentals:**

- **WebGL:** The underlying technology that powers Three.js. It's a JavaScript API that utilizes your graphics card to render stunning visuals.
- **Three.js:** A powerful JavaScript library that simplifies WebGL development, allowing you to create 3D scenes, objects, animations, and more with ease.

**Building Your First Scene:**

- **The Cube:** Your first step is to create a simple cube. Learn how to set up a basic scene, define the cube geometry, and apply materials to give it color and texture.
- **Transformations:** Manipulate your cube's position, rotation, and scale in 3D space to create interesting visual compositions.
- **Animations:** Bring your scene to life with animations. Explore techniques to move, rotate, or morph objects over time.

**Tools & Techniques:**

- **Vite Setup:** A modern build tool that speeds up your development process. Learn how to integrate Vite with Three.js for a smooth workflow.
- **Responsive Design:** Make your 3D scenes work seamlessly across different screen sizes and devices.
- **Orbit Controls:** Give users the ability to explore your scene by rotating and zooming the camera.
- **Geometries:** Beyond cubes, discover a wide array of geometric shapes: spheres, cylinders, planes, and more.
- **Textures & Materials:** Add realistic details to your objects using images and material properties to control appearance.

**Enhancing Your Scenes:**

- **lil-gui:** A powerful library that provides a user-friendly interface for tweaking and controlling parameters within your Three.js scenes.
- **Lights:** Illuminate your scene with various light sources, including directional, point, and ambient lights, to create realistic lighting effects.
- **Importing 3D Models:** Import pre-made 3D models from resources like Sketchfab to add more complex objects to your scenes.

**Resources:**

- **Sketchfab:** Discover a vast library of free and paid 3D models to incorporate into your Three.js projects.
