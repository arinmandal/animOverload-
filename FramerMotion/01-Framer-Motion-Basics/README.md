# 01 - Framer Motion Basics

This folder is my starting point with Framer Motion, a simple and powerful animation library for React.

Here, I got a sneak peek into what Framer Motion can doâ€”making animations easy and interactive for web apps. I explored how to add basic animations to components, especially using features like `whileHover` and `whileTap` for interactive effects.

As a first step, I built a button component styled with Tailwind CSS and animated with Framer Motion. This helped me understand how easy it is to make UI elements feel more dynamic and engaging.

Stay tuned for more experiments!
