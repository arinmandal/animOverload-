# 02 - Hover & Exit Animations

This folder is all about learning some cool animation features in Framer Motion. Here, I tried out things like `whileHover` for hover effects, `animate` for controlling how things show up, `exit` for how things disappear, and `AnimatePresence` to make those enter/exit animations smooth.

To practice, I built a card component that animates when you hover over it and also when you remove it from the screen. This helped me see how easy it is to make UI elements feel more lively and interactive with just a few lines of code.

If you're new to Framer Motion, this is a great place to see how simple and fun it is to add animations to your React projects!
